        <h1>My name is Alan !!!!</h1>
        <p>Im 30, from Ohio. I moved to Georgia over 4 years ago. I met my wife here so you could say its a pretty cool state ;) I worked in construction for a number of years in one form or another before fiding coding. Why coding ... Why not ! Its a great career choice and since I get to work with tech all day it adds to its attraction. I am looking forward to diving deeper into it :)</p>
